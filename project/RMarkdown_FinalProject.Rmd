# Data Origins 
Data was obtained from [“Data Is Plural”](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.data-is-plural.com/&ved=2ahUKEwjF3KWz5YiRAxUEVkEAHVTHKrYQFnoECCgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw21waTAlcdAq2a68pmQCcr2) a newsletter of useful and curious datasets published by Jeremy Singer-Vine. There have been 400 editions, dating from October 21, 2015 to August 27, 2025. 

The dataset used for this project, ["X-Wines Dataset"](https://github.com/rogerioxavier/X-Wines) by Rogério Xavier de Azambuja et al., comprises Wines and Wine Ratings of 100,000+ wines produced in 60+ countries and is publicly accessible on GitHub.The data was collected and standardised from “wine-specialised websites,” winery websites, and other sources and indicates each wine’s name, type, grape varieties, alcohol level, acidity level, country, region, winery and vintages. It also includes ratings on a 1-to-5 scale of those wines by 1 million anonymised users.


# Research Questions 
The first aim of this project is to determine whether certain characteristics of wine including wine type, ABV, body and acidity, have an effect on popularity (operationalised on a 1-to-5 scale, higher ratings represent more popular wine). 

# Data Preparation 
## Loading Packages ##
```{r setup-packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

```

## Importing Data ##
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#Import Wine Information Data
Wine_Info <- read_csv("Wine_Info.csv")
#Import Wine Ratings Data
Wine_Ratings <- read_csv("Wine_Ratings.csv")
```

```{r}
#here is the first few rows of raw data for Wine Information Data
head(Wine_Info, 10)

#here is the first few rows of raw data for Wine Ratings Data
head(Wine_Ratings, 10)
```

## Cleaning Data ##
This is the process of cleaning my data for the Wine Information Dataset.
```{r}
#select columns of raw data to keep from Wine Information Data
Wine_Info <- Wine_Info %>% 
  select(WineID, WineName, Type, ABV, Body, Acidity, Country, RegionName, Vintages)
```

This is the process of cleaning my data for the Wine Ratings Dataset.
```{r}
#select columns of raw data to keep from Wine Ratings Data
Wine_Ratings <- Wine_Ratings %>% 
  select(WineID, Vintage, Rating)

#sort columns of Wine Ratings Data in order of WineID
Wine_Ratings <- Wine_Ratings[order(Wine_Ratings$WineID), ]

#create overall wine rating for each Wine Name (WineID)
Wine_Overall <- Wine_Ratings %>%
  group_by(WineID) %>% 
  summarise(overall_rating = mean(Rating, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

This is the process of merging the datasets so that I have a comprehensive dataset that includes wine information and an average rating for each individual wine in the dataset.
```{r}
#merge datasets to one including both Wine Information and Overall Wine Rating
Wine_Final <- Wine_Info %>%
  left_join(Wine_Overall, by = "WineID")
```
